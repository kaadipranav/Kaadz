## 2026-05-05 — Month 3: Use @clerk/react not @clerk/nextjs for ClerkProvider
**Decision:** Import `ClerkProvider` from `@clerk/react`, not `@clerk/nextjs`. Wrap it in a `'use client'` component (`ClerkClientProvider.tsx`) before using in Next.js App Router layout.
**Why:** `@clerk/nextjs`'s `ClerkProvider` uses Server Actions internally, which are incompatible with `output: 'export'`. `@clerk/react`'s `ClerkProvider` is a pure React context provider with no server dependencies.
**What this rules out forever:** Using `@clerk/nextjs`'s `ClerkProvider` in the dashboard. All Clerk hooks (`useAuth`, `useUser`, etc.) should be imported from `@clerk/react`.

## 2026-05-05 — Month 3: Static Export Stays, Hash Routing for Sign-in
**Decision:** Dashboard remains `output: 'export'` + CF Pages. Sign-in page uses `<SignIn routing="hash" />`.
**Why:** OpenNext Cloudflare requires edge runtime for middleware. Next 16's `proxy.ts` always runs on Node.js runtime — `export const runtime = 'edge'` is rejected. Static export + CF Pages is the only working path on Windows without WSL.
**What this rules out forever:** Switching to OpenNext from Windows. If OpenNext is ever needed (e.g., for SSR auth), it must be built in WSL or CI.

## 2026-05-04 — Month 2: Flagging Uses Combined Score
**Decision:** `buildNodes()` uses `Math.max(ruleScore, judgeScore)` for the `isCompromised` check, not `judgeScore` alone.
**Why:** When the LLM judge fails (returns 0.0) but the rule scorer fires (0.9), nothing was getting flagged. The final severity is always `Math.max(ruleScore, judgeScore)` — the flagging logic must match.
**What this rules out forever:** Using only the judge result for flagging decisions. Any severity-based logic must use the combined score.

## 2026-05-04 — Month 2: Dashboard is Static Export
**Decision:** Dashboard uses `output: 'export'` + CF Pages. API key baked at build time via `NEXT_PUBLIC_WATCHLLM_API_KEY`.
**Why:** OpenNext has a Windows pipe bug (`write EOF`) on deploy. Static export + `wrangler pages deploy` works cleanly on Windows.
**What this rules out forever:** Deploying OpenNext from Windows directly. Month 3 must use WSL or CI for the OpenNext build when Clerk SSR middleware is needed.

## 2026-05-04 — Month 2: Cache Completed Traces Only
**Decision:** KV trace cache (`trace:{simId}`, TTL 3600s) stores only completed `TraceGraph` payloads. Never cache `{ status: 'pending' }` or error envelopes.
**Why:** Caching pending responses would cause the dashboard to show "trace not available" permanently for a simulation that later completes.
**What this rules out forever:** Caching any non-terminal trace state.

## 2026-05-04 — Month 2: Decorator Tests Use _check_threshold Directly
**Decision:** Decorator sign-off tests call `_check_threshold()` with known `SimulationResult` objects rather than asserting live severity values from decorator calls.
**Why:** The decorator always hits the mock agent endpoint with the attack payload. Severity depends on which attack is selected (seed = simId + category) — non-deterministic across runs.
**What this rules out forever:** Writing tests that assert a specific severity value from a live `@watchllm.test()` call.

## 2026-04-29 — Month 1 Learnings: LLM Judge Conservatism
**Decision:** CF AI's free model (@cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-int8) is conservative and doesn't always detect subtle compromises
**Why:** The free model focuses on obvious patterns. It correctly detected PII (0.70) and shell commands (0.90) but missed SQL injection and prompt leaks (both scored 0.00). The rule-based scorer compensates by catching most obvious patterns.
**What this rules out forever:** Relying solely on LLM judge for severity scoring. Rule-based scorer must remain the primary defense. In Month 2-3, we may experiment with different CF AI models or add more sophisticated rule patterns.

## 2026-04-29 — Month 1 Learnings: Test LLM Models Earlier
**Decision:** Should have tested multiple CF AI models during Week 2 (Days 6-10) to understand detection capabilities
**Why:** Understanding the LLM judge's limitations early would have allowed us to tune the rule-based scorer more aggressively or choose a different model. However, the current system works well enough for Month 1.
**What this rules out forever:** Assuming any LLM model will work without testing. Always test multiple models early in the development cycle to understand their strengths and weaknesses.

## 2025-XX-XX — Auth: Clerk Pro for dashboard
**Decision:** Using Clerk Pro for dashboard auth
**Why:** Free via existing plan, eliminates OAuth boilerplate
**What this rules out:** Supabase Auth, NextAuth, rolling our own session management

## 2025-XX-XX — 3 Workers, not 2
**Decision:** api-worker / orchestrator-worker / chaos-worker
**Why:** Orchestrator cleanly separates fan-out logic from HTTP concerns
**What this rules out:** Running fan-out inside the api-worker, 
collapsing orchestrator and chaos into one worker

## 2025-XX-XX — Monorepo
**Decision:** Single repo, npm workspaces
**Why:** Shared types, one git history, solo founder
**What this rules out:** Separate repos per service

## 2025-XX-XX — No any types, ever
**Decision:** strict TypeScript, zero any
**Why:** Agents produce undetectable bugs under loose typing
**What this rules out:** Quick fixes with any, casting through unknown
